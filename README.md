### 🧭 Objective

The objective of this project is to simulate a secure, locked-down, auditable browser-based assessment environment for high-stakes candidate evaluations.

**The system ensures that:**
```text
- Candidates remain focused on the test window
- Distractions and misuse are detected
- All suspicious activities are logged
- A complete, timestamped audit trail is maintained

This implementation follows the requirements outlined in the Secure Test Environment Enforcement – Problem Definition Document.
```

### 🚀 Features

**1️⃣ Browser Enforcement**

****🔍 Focus & Tab Monitoring****
```text
- Detects tab switches (visibilitychange)
- Detects window blur/focus loss
- Detects multiple tabs using BroadcastChannel
- Treats any focus loss as a violation
- Displays immediate warning overlay
- Increments violation counter
```
****🔐 Fullscreen Enforcement****
```text
- Automatically enters fullscreen mode on load
- Detects fullscreen exit attempts
- Logs fullscreen violations
```
🚫 Copy / Paste Prevention
```text
- Prevents copy attempts
- Prevents paste attempts
- Logs all misuse attempts
```

**2️⃣ Unified Event Logging System**

****📑 Event Schema****
Each event follows a structured and unified format:
```json
{
  "eventType": "tab_switch",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-12T10:30:00.000Z",
  "attemptId": "ATTEMPT_001",
  "questionId": "Q1",
  "metadata": {
    "browser": "...",
    "focusState": true,
    "url": "https://example.com"
  }
}
```
****📦 Logging Capabilities****
```text
- Logs all browser enforcement events
- Logs fullscreen activity
- Logs focus restoration
- Logs copy/paste attempts
- Persists logs in localStorage
- Batches and sends logs to backend every 10 seconds
- Prevents log loss during refresh/offline scenarios
```

## ▶️ How to Run
**1️⃣ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd secure-test-enforcement
```
**2️⃣ Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```
**3️⃣ Start Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```
**4️⃣ Open in Chrome**

Open the application in Google Chrome and test the following:
```
- Switch tabs
- Open another tab of the same app
- Minimize window
- Attempt copy/paste
- Exit fullscreen
```
You will see:
```
- Violation counter increment
- Warning overlay displayed
- Console audit logs
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations
```
- Events are timestamped and immutable once stored
- Logs persist during refresh/offline
- Batch submission reduces backend load
- Multiple tab detection uses same-origin communication
- Violations are throttled to prevent event spam
```
---

## 📈 Future Enhancements
```
- Backend integration with Spring Boot
- Server-side log immutability enforcement
- Attempt termination after max violations
- Timer-based assessment module
- Screenshot monitoring (if allowed)
- WebSocket real-time monitoring dashboard for employers
```

## ✅ Conclusion
```
This project demonstrates how a browser-based assessment platform can enforce focus, prevent misuse, and maintain a secure, auditable testing environment using modern web APIs and React architecture.
The implementation is modular, scalable, and production-ready for backend integration.
